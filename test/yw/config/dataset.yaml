# YOLOv8 Dataset Configuration File
# ------------------------------------
# Usage:
#   from ultralytics import YOLO
#   model = YOLO('yolov8n-obb.pt')
#   results = model.train(data='D:/yongwoo/Software_project/projects/deeplearning-repo-1/test/yw/config/dataset.yaml', epochs=100)
#
# Notes:
# - Paths must be absolute or relative to the 'ultralytics' installation directory.
# - It's recommended to use absolute paths to avoid ambiguity.

# Path to the root directory of the dataset
path: D:/yongwoo/Software_project/projects/deeplearning-repo-1/test/yw/data/processed

# Train, validation, and test set directories (relative to 'path')
train: images/train
val: images/val
test: images/test

# Class names (map class indices to names)
# IMPORTANT: The order must match the class indices used in the label files.
names:
  0: person
  1: shopping_cart
  # Add more class names as needed
  # 2: product_a
  # 3: product_b
